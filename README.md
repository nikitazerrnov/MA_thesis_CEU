# MA_thesis_CEU

The following is a Public GitHub repository containing the files and scripts used to perform the empiric analysis for the MA Thesis at Central European University 2023 titled "Technology and the Future of Work: Comparing the Potential Impact of AI Industrialisation on Labour Markets in Liberal and Coordinated Market Economies".

Note that some of the files uploaded in .Rdata format were localy generated due to 1) their external origin - i.e., Google Patents Dataset, or 2) the computational intensity of their generation. 

The file main_1.Rmd contains the full script used to generate the data for the Thesis (though in a rather messy way). Task Statements is a O_NET dataset containing the information on US job tasks. de_tasks_translated is a manually built dataset with the same data but for Germany. verb_object_pairs_patents_NEW.Rdata is dataset of the VN pairs from patents. The patetns dataset itself cannot be uploaded since even in the compressed version it weights > 100 MB which is not supported by GitHub.
